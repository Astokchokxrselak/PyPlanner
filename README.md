# PyPlanner
Project meant to assist with assignment planning and scheduling in order to combat procrastination and increase accountability (now in Python!).
All tasks entered into the planner are referred to as "Assignments."

**[WINDOWS ONLY]**

# Capabilities
- The PyPlanner will have an interface that can be fully controlled by command line or via keyboard-only navigation (mostly implemented)
- The PyPlanner will take advantage of the windows Toast notification system to alert users of assignments either when they're due, when they're to be started, or randomly (at the user's discretion). (somewhat implemented)
- Assignments are designed modularly based on attributes, allowing for maximal customization down to what they're referred to as and what they say when they pop up. Templates for easily adding assignments is also planned. (about 33% done)
